# Alfred Workflows

### Why
As a developer I use a lot editors, keyboard and terminal. Alfred is a great tool that lets you achive some tasks without stop typing.

But I found some tasks to be missing on Alfred so I decided to write the plugins on my own. I hope to help you burst your productivity away from the mouse.

### Requirements
Please note these are just plugins. You'll need Alfred 2.2+ and its Powerpack.
You can get both [here](http://www.alfredapp.com).

Unfortunately, Alfred only runs on OS X (Snow Leopard and above). I wish there'd be something like it on Linux.

### Installation
Clone the repo or download the .zip. Then double clic to install the workflow you want.
